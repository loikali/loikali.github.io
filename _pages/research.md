### **A Search for Wide-orbit Planets Around M-dwarfs using Deep MIRI 15-µm Images**

*Feb 2025 – Present*  
**Supervised by Prof. Yifan Zhou**  

Submitted to AAS in Nov 2025.  
[The submitted manuscript can be found here](https://github.com/loikali/MIRI_Planet_Search_paper)

- Used archival JWST/MIRI time-series observations of ten M-dwarfs to search for wide-orbit gas giants through direct imaging, providing the first sensitivity assessment of this observing mode for planet detection.  
- Constructed reference libraries based on observation subarrays and developed a pipeline to optimize PSF subtraction parameters for each target star.  
- Calculated survey sensitivity limits and combined contrast curves with planet evolutionary models to derive detectable planet mass limits.  
- Demonstrated that such observations are sensitive to Jupiter-radius planets with 1-bar temperatures (~170 K) at separations of 35 AU in systems at 12.5 pc.

### **Searching for Substructures in Two of the Youngest, Largest, and Brightest Protostellar Disks**  
*Oct 2025 – Present*  
**Supervised by Prof. Ruobing Dong and Prof. Feng Long**

- Reducing and analyzing ALMA imaging data of protostellar disks to characterize substructures and investigate their formation mechanisms.

### **Stellar Properties of a T Tauri Star (PR Ori A)**  
*Sep 2024 – Dec 2024*  
**Supervised by Prof. Gregory Herczeg**

- Estimated stellar properties (effective temperature, *v* sin *i*, radial velocity, mass, and age) of the T Tauri star PR Ori A.  
- Developed a Python pipeline to match the observed spectrum with processed template spectra and calculated its luminosity based on Gaia colors.

### **Metallicity of Outbursting Circumstellar Disks**  
*May 2024 – Dec 2024*  
**Supervised by Prof. Gregory Herczeg**

- Refined existing models to measure metallicity in the inner disk of a FU Ori object, contributing to the understanding of accretion processes in young stellar objects.
